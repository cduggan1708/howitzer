Assumptions made while implementing the Howitzer shooting practice UI
Working with a team, I would verify these assumptions before finalizing design but, for purposes of this code challenge, I simply documenting and going forward with assumptions.

Specs I was given with assumptions inline:

1) The user should visit a screen and be presented with the following information (which changes with each visit):
A: USER REGISTION NOT NEEDED (SEE #4)
  a) The weight of the howitzer shell.
  A: THIS IS NEEDED TO CALCULATE AIR DRAG; WILL ONLY FACTOR INTO EQUATION IF TIME PERMITS
  A: GOT VALUES BASED ON GOOGLE SEARCH OF HOWITZER SHELLS
  b) The distance to the target.
  A: GOT VALUES BASED ON GOOGLE SEARCH OF HOWITZER CANNON RANGES
  c) The size of the target.
  A: THIS IS A LANDING PAD IN SQUARE SHAPE, LAID FLAT ON GROUND
  
2) The user should be able to set the following options:
  a) The angle of the howitzer barrel relative to the ground.
  b) The muzzle speed (Preferably a list of pre-selected speeds).
  A: GOT VALUES BASED ON GOOGLE SEARCH OF HOWITZER MUZZEL VELOCITIES

3) The user should be able to set the above options and select ‘Fire’. The application should calculate the trajectory of the shell and return the following:
A: USING MOST BASIC TRAJECTORY EQUATION; IF TIME PERMITS INCLUDE AIR DRAG
  a) Whether the target was hit or missed.
  b) How far away from the target the shell landed.

4) In addition, the trajectories of every shot should be recorded into the DB, along with general information on the current user.  
This doesn’t necessarily have to be identifiable info, but browser info, location if available, etc.
A: USER MUST ENTER NAME BEFORE BEING ALLOWED TO 'FIRE'
A: CREATED A FLEXIBLE USER METADATA DB SINCE SPEC DOESN'T SPECIFY WHICH INFO TO TRACK
  -IF TIME PERMITS COULD IMPLEMENT AN API TO GET USER IP LOCATION (IE. IP2LOCATION)

5) The following information should always be displayed:
  a) Total shots for this user.
  b) Total shots for all users.
  c) Total Users.
  d) Avg number of shots to hit the target.
  A: AVG NUM FOR ALL USERS
  e) Top 5 most accurate users, along with a breakout of their shot counts and general accuracy.
  f) User’s ranking once he/she hits target.

6) Application should be written in PHP with a Mysql DB back end. The UI display and feature set is completely open-ended and at coder’s discretion provided that it meets the minimum requirements above.

7) Ballistics calculations should be accurate for earth standard gravity (or if the coder is feeling creative, a settable gravity).
